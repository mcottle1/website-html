        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Mackenzie Cottle. I am currently a Sophmore at Brigham Young
          University. I am studying Computer Science as well as pursuing a Business
          minor. I also work for the university as a Teaching Assistant for the CS 252 
          course titled Theory of Computation under Professor Ng. I look forward to 
          attending graduate school and am contemplating pursuing a Juris Doctor Degree.
          I love to learn and have thuroughly enjoyed my time and study at Brigham
          Young University, and am thuroughly looking forward to the years to come! 
        </p>
        <p>
          I am originally from Bountiful, Utah. I attended Bountiful High School. 
          I have one brother who is currently studying at Utah State University
          and is looking forward to playing football for that university. I love 
          all activities that are outdoors, and in my freetime I like to hike with
          my dog or swim/boat. I love to travel and am looking forward to studying
          abroad with Brigham Young University this coming spring. I traveled last 
          spring to India with my university, and look forward to studying in Europe
          this coming spring.

          Have you ever heard of habit stacking? Habit stacking is a revolutionary way 
          to create and maintain habits: a notoriously difficult task. Habit stacking 
          relies on the "stacking" new habits on habits that already exist in order to 
          help the individual to remember to do them! For example, a habit stack might 
          include stacking drinking a glass of water on top of brushing your teeth. You 
          might commit to the statement "After brushing my teeth, I will drink a glass 
          of water." Voila! A habit stack! The Habit Stacker application makes this 
          process easy by allowing users to input their current habits as well as the 
          habits that they would like to create and generating a habit stack for them 
          that can be printed off or checked off within the application as tasks are 
          completed each day! Habit stacks and progress can be shared in real time among 
          users to generate community motivation to create and stick to new habits!
